// baseline its first claim by agents. It counts only when OpenAI or Anthropic made it.

// is an exact rational or an A d^p claim. A row with no such bar gives null, and its Lean Verified posts are held back.
// An xBar is a rational at most the true value on a higher-is-better row, at least it on a lower-is-better row, so a
// bound that is worse than the bar is worse than the breakthrough. A breakthrough at +infinity on a lower-is-better row
// (Catalan) is beaten by every finite bound: no bar. A score that is the breakthrough's own value text (the Lean Verified
// row of that breakthrough, Anthropic's critical-line expression) is the same bound: `same`.
